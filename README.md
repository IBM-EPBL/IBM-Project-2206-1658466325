Visualizing and Predicting Heart Diseases with an Interactive Dash Board

This project aims to visualize and predict the presence of heart disease based on various factors that might cause heart disease. We will analyze the heart disease 
dataset and gain insights which then helps to know the factor which causes high severity to patients. Based on that, we will be choosing a suitable machine learning
model to detect the probability of a patient having heart disease. Machine Learning models helps us to make better decisions. Even though, heart disease might occur
in variant forms, there are several factors which are quite common. Taking those into account, we propose an effective method to predict the heart disease by analyzing
and visualizing the causes of heart disease.
